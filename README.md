# Functions Calculator
**written by Ronen Heifetz && Leon Markovich**

Functions Calculator is a calculator capable of performing basic operations on a given set of functions, such as generating new functions out of already generated once, and evaluation at a real point in the domain of a certain function.


**Following is the list of the calculator's available commands:**
**"eval(uate) num x "**- Evaluates function #num on x
**"poly(nomial)N c0 c1 ... cN-1"**- Creates a polynomial with N coefficients
**"mul(tiply)"**num1 num2 - Creates a function that is the multiplication of function #num1 and function #num2
**"add num1 num2 "**- Creates a function that is the sum of function #num1 and function #num2
**"comp(osite)"** num1 num2 - Creates a function that is the composition offunction #num1 and function #num2
**"log N num"** - Creates a function that computes log N of function #num
**"del(ete) num"**- Deletes function #num from function list

**"help"** - Prints this help screen
**"exit"**- Exits the program

**NOTE**: every number in this function is rounded to 2 points after the decimal dot, beside powers in polynomials

# Details and design
The functions are displayed on the terminal in the form of a list, onto which the user can add the wanted function, using commands that operate on a function or a pair of functions.
